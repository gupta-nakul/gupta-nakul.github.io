## Work Experience
**Software Engineer @ Scry AI (_June 2021 - July 2023_)**
- Led the design and development of CoAP Protocol in Java, using Object-Oriented Programming principles and best practices, to receive data from field-deployed sensors, working seamlessly with a team consisting of a Senior Developer and a new Software Engineer.
- Guided an intern by assigning sub-tasks related to backend improvements, enhancing my skills in people management and task prioritization. Supervised a new Software Engineer, assigning small tasks to familiarize them with the project flow and efficiently transferring knowledge.
- Created a Data Retention Plugin to retain data in an H2 database based on specified time intervals. This optimized data retention for transfer between the cloud and the server.
- Managed the design, development, and load testing of the MQTT Protocol flow to receive data from smart meters/devices and send back commands using Java and Spring Boot-based REST APIs. Established the entire MQTT pipeline to start receiving around 1,000,000 data points from NEOM.
- Refactored Spring Boot-based REST APIs to update the MongoDB database, enhancing my debugging and troubleshooting skills. This optimization facilitated future updates to the APIs.

## Projects
**Credit Card Fraud Transaction Detection**, CSCI 573 **(_October 2023 - December 2023_)**

[Github](https://github.com/gupta-nakul/fraud-detection)
- Conducted Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on the given data to look for possible imbalance in the data and for possible feature engineering.
- Performed feature engineering to extract the most important features using Principal Components Analysis (PCA).
- Balanced the dataset using the SMOTE technique and weight balancing based on the minority class.
- Implemented and tuned XGBoost and LightGBM to achieve optimal classification accuracy of 89% and a high precision value of 85% which was a priority to classify as many fraudulent transactions as possible.

**Metaphor Detection**, CSCI 578 **(_October 2023 - December 2023_)**
- Performed data preprocessing and Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to clean and understand the data.
- Utilized Word2Vec and BERT embeddings to capture semantic meaning and context of the sentence.
- Developed multiple ML models, including XGBoost and Logistic Regression, to identify metaphors in text.
- Implemented Bidirectional LSTM as the hero model to leverage sequential information and achieve superior
performance in identifying metaphors.
