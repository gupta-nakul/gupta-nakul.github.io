**Data Engineer @ Scry AI (_June 2021 - July 2023_)**
- Led the design and development of CoAP Protocol in Java, using Object-Oriented Programming principles and best practices, to reduced data processing time by 30% for the data received from field-deployed sensors, working seamlessly with a team consisting of a Senior Developer and a new Software Engineer.
- Guided an intern by assigning sub-tasks related to backend improvements, enhancing my skills in people management and task prioritization. Supervised a new Software Engineer, assigning small tasks to familiarize them with the project flow and efficiently transferring knowledge.
- Designed and implemented a Data Retention Plugin for H2 database (SQL-based), reducing storage overhead and improving query efficiency.
- Managed the design, development, and testing of the MQTT Protocol flow to process around a million data points received from NEOM's smart meters using using Java, Spring Boot, and Kafka.
- Refactored Spring Boot-based REST APIs to update the MongoDB database, enhancing my debugging and troubleshooting skills. This optimization facilitated future updates to the APIs.

## Machine Learning Projects
**Credit Card Fraud Transaction Detection**, CSCI 573 **(_October 2023 - December 2023_)**

[Github](https://github.com/gupta-nakul/fraud-detection)
- Conducted Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on the given data to look for possible imbalance in the data and for possible feature engineering.
- Performed feature engineering to extract the most important features using Principal Components Analysis (PCA).
- Balanced the dataset using the SMOTE technique and weight balancing based on the minority class.
- Implemented and tuned XGBoost and LightGBM to achieve optimal classification accuracy of 89% and a high precision value of 85% which was a priority to classify as many fraudulent transactions as possible.

**Metaphor Detection**, CSCI 578 **(_October 2023 - December 2023_)**
- Performed data preprocessing and Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to clean and understand the data.
- Utilized Word2Vec and BERT embeddings to capture semantic meaning and context of the sentence.
- Developed multiple ML models, including XGBoost and Logistic Regression, to identify metaphors in text.
- Implemented Bidirectional LSTM as the hero model to leverage sequential information and achieve superior performance in identifying metaphors.

## Leadership Experience
**Senior Supervisor @ Indiana University Testing Center(_January 2024 - Present_)**
- Trained 10+ proctors, enabling skill development and decision taking; successfully guided 4 to become senior proctors and 2 to transition into supervisory roles within 4 months.
