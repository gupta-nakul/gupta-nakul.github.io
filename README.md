## Work Experience
**Software Engineer @ Scry AI (_June 2021 - July 2023_)**
- Led the design and development of CoAP Protocol in Java, using Object-Oriented Programming principles and best practices, to receive data from field-deployed sensors, working seamlessly with a team consisting of a Senior Developer and a new Software Engineer.
- Guided an intern by assigning sub-tasks related to backend improvements, enhancing my skills in people management and task prioritization. Supervised a new Software Engineer, assigning small tasks to familiarize them with the project flow and efficiently transferring knowledge.
- Created a Data Retention Plugin to retain data in an H2 database based on specified time intervals. This optimized data retention for transfer between the cloud and the server.
- Managed the design, development, and load testing of the MQTT Protocol flow to receive data from smart meters/devices and send back commands using Java and Spring Boot-based REST APIs. Established the entire MQTT pipeline to start receiving around 1,000,000 data points from NEOM.
- Refactored Spring Boot-based REST APIs to update the MongoDB database, enhancing my debugging and troubleshooting skills. This optimization facilitated future updates to the APIs.
